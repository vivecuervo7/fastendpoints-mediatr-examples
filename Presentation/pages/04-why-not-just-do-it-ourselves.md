<h1>FastEndpoints</h1>
<h2>More bang for your buck</h2>

<ul class="content">
  <li>Encourages the use of vertical slices — no more “endpoint here” and “handler there”</li>
  <li>Introduces strong conventions, lowering the surface area for disagreement</li>
  <li>Reduced boilerplate — less code to read, write and maintain</li>
  <li>Facilitates many of the common features that typically need to be tacked onto every project, such as validation, mapping and error handling</li>
</ul>
