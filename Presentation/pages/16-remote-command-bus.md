  <li>Allows for handling commands on a separate server</li>
  <v-clicks>
    <li>Uses the existing <strong>ICommand</strong> and <strong>ICommandHandler</strong> interfaces, just requiring them to be registered as remote procedures â€” no need for .proto files</li>

<!--
Sitting on top of gRPC for .NET, we can also easily allow for separate servers to handle our commands.

Now, I've never really had to use this gRPC at all, mostly just knowing that it was a thing out there.

[click] However it's made pretty easy easy for us, with FastEndpoints wrapping the implementation under, once again, our commands!

[click] There is a little more setup required, with each remote procedure needing to be registered individually.

Alright, I don't want to go into too much depth here, as we're starting to get into the very problem-specific areas that these features address, but to cover this at a high level at least, we start with once again, our command.

[click] And, once again all we need to do is change our method call, this time to `RemoteExecuteAsync`.

We do need to tell FastEndpoints where to find the handler, which we do in our `Program.cs` file. [click]

Assuming we have the server running at that URL [click], we can then register our command and its handler.

Conceptually, it's pretty straightforward, although I _did_ get caught out with the namespace I was using for the shared command &mdash; hopefully it'll save anybody else the pain, but I discovered that if they don't match, then this isn't going to work.

That one is probably more showing my lack of knowledge when it comes to gRPC though, as from from what I read it was probably just resulting in the wrong namespace being used in the `proto` file under the hood.

But, there is a bit a gotcha there that isn't all too obvious.
