<h1>Why?</h1>
<h2>What drove me to FastEndpoints?</h2>

<ul class="content">
  <li>A feeling of over-abstracted code in what were often relatively simple APIs</li>
  <li>Stumbled across FastEndpoints online and started tinkering with it out of curiosity</li>
  <li>FastEndpoints felt easy to use where the typical architecture felt cumbersome</li>
  <li>Commercialisation of MediatR led me to consider FastEndpoints as a genuine alternative</li>
</ul>
