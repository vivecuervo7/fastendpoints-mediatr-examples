<!-- 
FastEndpoints!

FastEndpoints is, in it's own words, "a developer friendly alternative to Minimal APIs and MVC".

Ultimately, it offers a different way to structure our code. Nothing under the hood is fundamentally different to any large degree, rather it presents a friendly wrapper around much of the functionality we tend to use when building APIs.

  Why?
</div>

<!-- 
And there's a big question in "why".

In particular, it's the "developer-friendly" claim that really dragged me in.

I've certainly not found Minimal API, MVC, MediatR to be particularly developer _un_ friendly, so why even look for an alternative?

<h1>Why?</h1>
<h2>What drove me to FastEndpoints?</h2>

<ul class="content">
  <li>A feeling of over-abstracted code in what were often relatively simple APIs</li>
  <v-clicks>
    <li>Stumbled across FastEndpoints online and started tinkering with it out of curiosity</li>
    <li>FastEndpoints seemed easy to use where the typical architecture felt cumbersome</li>
    <li>Commercialisation of MediatR led me to consider FastEndpoints as a genuine alternative</li>
  </v-clicks>
</ul>

<!-- 
One of the things that I have frequently observed across multiple projects now, is a tendency to jump straight into heavy abstractions, and moving bits of code everywhere amongst the codebase to fit into particular "layers".

One of my favourite terms I've come across as a complaint with .NET is that we have an "abstraction fetish".

Really though, I never found the current landscape of API development in .NET to be off-putting by any stretch.

FastEndpoints was something I discovered much by accident, half-watching YouTube while laying in bed. Something about a particular video caught my eye, and I found myself re-watching it with much more intent.

Now, while I say "something" caught my eye, I realised in hindsight exactly what it was.

Anybody who has worked with me over the past couple of years knows I'm quite a fan of SvelteKit &mdash; but in particular it's the simplicity and ease of development that appeals to me.

It's a framework that I _want_ to work with &mdash; it makes my work _enjoyable_.

Right off the bat, FastEndpoints looked like it offered a similar, no-nonsense, cohesive approach to development.

That said, much like SvelteKit, it felt like it would be a framework that would always live in the shadow of the status quo.

It didn't seem like many would be too eager to move away from the stock-standard MediatR-based approach that I've seen in 90% of the projects I've worked on.

And then, all of a sudden the dollar signs started to appear.

The commercialisation of MediatR gave me a _very_ good reason to go back and really give FastEndpoints a proper assessment, to see if it could actually slot into our typical projects and not just replace MediatR, but actually improve the overall developer experience.
