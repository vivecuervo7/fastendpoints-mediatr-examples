<!-- 
FastEndpoints!

FastEndpoints is, in it's own words, "a developer friendly alternative to Minimal APIs and MVC".

Ultimately, it offers a different way to structure our code.

Nothing under the hood is fundamentally different to any large degree, mostly just a friendly wrapper around much of the functionality we already to use when building APIs in .NET.

  Why?
</div>

<!-- 
And there's a big question in "why".

In particular, it's the "developer-friendly" claim that really dragged me in.

I've certainly not found Minimal API, MVC, MediatR to be particularly developer UNfriendly, so why even look for an alternative?

<h1>Why?</h1>
<h2>What drove me to FastEndpoints?</h2>

<ul class="content">
  <li>A feeling of over-abstracted code in what were often relatively simple APIs</li>
  <v-clicks>
    <li>Stumbled across FastEndpoints online and started tinkering with it out of curiosity</li>
    <li>FastEndpoints seemed easy to use where the typical architecture felt cumbersome</li>
    <li>Commercialisation of MediatR led me to consider FastEndpoints as a genuine alternative</li>
  </v-clicks>
</ul>

<!-- 
One of the things that I've frequently observed across multiple projects now, is a tendency to jump straight into heavy abstractions, and moving bits of code everywhere to fit into particular "layers".

Really though, I don't find the current landscape of API development in .NET to be off-putting by any stretch, but there has always been this nagging feeling of it just being a _little_ bit more than it needs to be. [click]

FastEndpoints was something I discovered almost by accident.

I was half-watching YouTube while laying in bed, and something about a particular video caught my eye, and I found myself re-watching it the next day, quite intrigued by it. [click]

At the risk of bringing up something that is well and truly not .NET-related, anybody who has worked with me over the past couple of years knows I'm quite a fan of SvelteKit &mdash; in particular, the simplicity and ease of development that it brings.

It's a framework that I _want_ to work with &mdash; and it makes my work really enjoyable.

Right off the bat, FastEndpoints looked like it offered a similar, no-nonsense, cohesive approach to building APIs.

That said, much like SvelteKit, it felt doomed to live in the shadow of the status quo.

It didn't seem like many would be too eager to move away from the stock-standard MediatR-based approach that I've seen in 90% of the projects I've worked on. [click]

And then, all of a sudden the dollar signs started to appear, and the commercialisation of MediatR gave me a _very_ good reason to go back and really give FastEndpoints a proper assessment.

I wanted to see if it could actually slot into our typical projects and not just replace MediatR, but actually improve the overall developer experience.
