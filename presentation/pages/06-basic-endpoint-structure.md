So, looking at our overall structure, we'll focus on the implementation of a very basic endpoint before we start diving into the other features.

There is some registration for FastEndpoints required in our `Program.cs` file, but we'll skip over that as it's not anything too unexpected.

Starting with the most basic endpoint possible [click], we need to create a class which inherits from `EndpointWithoutRequest`.

This is the simplest of the base endpoint classes, used when we have neither a request nor response DTO.

To configure the endpoint [click], we simply override the `Configure` method.

Here we can use one of FastEndpoints' helper methods to register our route.

The example here uses the `Get` method to register a standard endpoint using the HTTP GET method.

As might be expected [click], calling `Post` would register a POST route and so forth.

We can also call other helper methods here [click], such as `AllowAnonymous`.

A little quirk of FastEndpoints is that it requires authorization for all endpoints by default.

If that's not desired, we can configure that globally in our `Program.cs`, so we _can_ change this, but it's just something to be aware of.

[click] Helper methods are also available to describe the endpoint...

[click] Or even configure CORS on a per-endpoint basis.

[click] We can also enhance Swagger documentation through the `Summary` method...

[click] And if we want to avoid cluttering up our endpoint, this can be moved to a separate class that inherits from `Summary`, with the endpoint passed to it as a type parameter.

This will get automatically registered to the endpoint, so there's no need to go wiring things up manually.

Coming back to our basic endpoint [click], we still need a place to put our handler code, and we do this by overriding the `HandleAsync` method. [click]

Essentially, this is where we would put the code that would otherwise live in our application layer.

Of course, nothing is stopping us from simply passing this off to a MediatR pipeline, but this in my mind undermines the value of having this nice little file that contains all of our endpoint's logic.

[click] Marking this as async allows us to return a response by calling one of many helper methods.

In this case, we're calling `SendOkAsync` which returns a response with a 200 status code.

FastEndpoints offers a few convenience methods here.

Without listing them all, we have options such as `SendNotFoundAsync`, or `SendForbiddenAsync` which do very much what they say on the label.

Now, the first gotcha that I encountered with FastEndpoints came up right here.

Using `await` here makes it seem like we can execute code _after_ the request has been sent, but in practice this just wasn't the case.

To prevent that from misleading devs, an alternative is available if we override a different method to `HandleAsync`.

[click] The `ExecuteAsync` method allows us to specify a strict return type for the method, which brings the implementation a little closer to what we're typically used to.

[click] As with Minimal API, we can also use the `Results` union type to allow for multiple possible return values.

Ultimately though, this comes down to a trade-off between using those expressive helper methods, and adding guardrails for ourselves.

We'll focus now on the first line here [click], where we can see we've passed a return type to `EndpointWithoutRequest`.

This is a good segue into the different base classes we can inherit from when we're creating a new endpoint.

We started by inheriting from `EndpointWithoutRequest` [click] with _no_ type parameter. As mentioned earlier, this is used when we have neither a request nor response DTO.

By passing in a type for our response [click], we're now describing an endpoint with no request DTO, but _with_ a response DTO.

[click] Inheriting from the `Endpoint` class expects that we provide a type for the request DTO, and optionally [click], we can pass in a type for the response DTO if we're returning one.

Once we've got a request object [click], we can pass it into the `HandleAsync` method, and start using it in our handler code.

Which brings us nicely to the topic of model binding!
