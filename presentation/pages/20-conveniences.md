<!--
There are a handful of other things that FastEndpoints looks to make easier for us, but I won't go into them in detail here.

These include things like easy route-based versioning of endpoints [click], caching [click], rate limiting [click], and scaffolding via dotnet templates. [click]

There's also an OpenAPI generator that I _haven't_ tried using, but that's also an interesting option to say the least...

Although, it might give you an idea of how FastEndpoints might look in an existing project without having to do a lot of the legwork.
