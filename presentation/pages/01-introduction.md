<!-- 
FastEndpoints!

FastEndpoints is, in it's own words, "a developer friendly alternative to Minimal APIs and MVC".

Ultimately, it just offers us a different way to structure our code.

Nothing under the hood is fundamentally different to any large degree, mostly just providing a friendly wrapper around much of the functionality that we already use when building APIs in .NET.

  Why?
</div>

<!-- 
And there's a big question in "why".

Is there even anything wrong with the way we do things now?

And while the way we do things does work, I've never been able to shake this feeling that we often make things more complicated than it needs to be.

Ultimately though, it was the "developer-friendly" claim that really dragged me in.

And actually seeing how the endpoints looked in practice made me sit up and pay attention.

<h1>Why?</h1>
<h2>What drove me to FastEndpoints?</h2>

<ul class="content">
  <li>A feeling of over-abstracted code in what were often relatively simple APIs</li>
  <v-clicks>
    <li>Stumbled across FastEndpoints online and started tinkering with it out of curiosity</li>
    <li>FastEndpoints seemed easy to use where the typical architecture felt cumbersome</li>
    <li>Commercialisation of MediatR led me to consider FastEndpoints as a genuine alternative</li>
  </v-clicks>
</ul>

<!-- 
One of the things that I've frequently observed across multiple projects now, is a tendency to jump straight into heavy abstractions, and moving bits of code everywhere to fit into particular "layers".

While I don't find the current landscape of API development in .NET to be off-putting by any stretch, it often feels like it's just a _little_ bit more than it needs to be. [click]

FastEndpoints was something I discovered almost completely by accident.

I was half-watching YouTube while laying in bed one night, and something about a particular video caught my eye.

I was still thinking about it the next day, and found myself re-watching it, quite intrigued by it. [click]

At the risk of bringing up something that is well and truly not .NET-related, anybody who has worked with me over the past couple of years knows I'm quite a fan of SvelteKit &mdash; in particular, the simplicity and ease of development that it brings.

It's a framework that I _want_ to work with &mdash; and it makes my work really enjoyable.

And right off the bat, FastEndpoints looked like it hits the same notes.

It offered a similar no-nonsense, cohesive approach to building APIs.

That said however, much like SvelteKit, it felt doomed to live in the shadow of the status quo.

I didn't too many people would would be keen on moving away from the tried and true MediatR-based approach that I've seen in 90% of the projects I've worked on. [click]

And then, all of a sudden MediatR went commercial.

The commercialisation of MediatR gave me a _very_ good reason to go back and really give FastEndpoints a proper assessment.

I wanted to see if it could actually slot into our typical projects and not just replace MediatR, but actually improve the overall developer experience.
